Hello everybody, my name is Joshua, and today I want to show you how you can build your own **machine learning** system to **classify documents**. That means automatically sorting text, like articles, emails, or job listings, into the right categories based on their content. This is incredibly useful when you have large amounts of text and want the computer to help you organize it.

The first step is to enable your model to understand the text. You do that by running a process called **TF-IDF**, which stands for *Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency*. You apply it to all of your documents, and it turns each one into a list of numbers. These numbers represent how **important** each word is in that document.

What TF-IDF actually does is look at how often a word appears in a **single document** and compare it to how often that word appears across the **whole collection**. This helps the system focus on words that are **unique** or **meaningful**, rather than common words like "the" or "and."

For example, if you're trying to separate **job postings** from other types of documents, a word like **salary** might show up a lot more often in job ads. That makes it a useful **indicator** for that category.

So, where’s the Machine Learning?

Once your text is converted into these useful numbers, that’s where the **machine learning** comes in. You can use a model called **logistic regression**, which is a **classification algorithm**. It looks at the patterns in your data and calculates how likely a document is to belong to each possible category — for example, whether it’s a job posting or not.

The model then picks the most likely category and assigns that label to the document.

At the beginning, your model *will make mistakes*, because all it has are initial assumptions about what words mean. For example, it might wrongly assume that the word "salary" belongs to a product review category instead of the job postings category. 

This is where the model learns. After each mistake, it gets feedback on what the correct answer should have been, and it adjusts itself. So over time, as the model sees more examples and corrects its wrong guesses, it becomes more accurate at making predictions.

So to sum it up: if you want to build a **machine learning** system for **document classification**, you start by using **TF-IDF** to extract the most **important words**. Then, you apply **logistic regression** to predict the right **category**. As the model sees more data and learns from its mistakes, it becomes better and better at assigning labels to text documents.
